[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/27bc341af2dc449dad2dbfc90bffa329)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/jasonray/RPN-calculator?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=jasonray/RPN-calculator&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This exercise was used during a coding kata.

The RPN [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation] calculator implementation is a good exercise for working through a languages capabilities and exploring OO strategies.

I have done three variations of the RPN calculator as exploratory into languages: 
- java [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator] 
- scala [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-scala]
- JavaScript with node.js [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-node]
