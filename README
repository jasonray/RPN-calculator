RPN calculator

This exercise was used during a coding kata.

The RPN [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation] calculator implementation is a good exercise for working through a languages capabilities and exploring OO strategies.

I have done three variations of the RPN calculator as exploratory into languages: 
- java [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator] 
- scala [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-scala]
- javascript on node.js [https://github.com/jasonray/RPN-calculator-node]
